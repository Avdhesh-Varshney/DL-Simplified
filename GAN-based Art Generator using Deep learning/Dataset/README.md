## ðŸ“Š Dataset Used

The dataset used for training the GAN model consists of artistic images collected from various online sources. This dataset typically includes a diverse range of artwork styles, encompassing paintings, sketches, and digital art.

### Dataset Characteristics:
- **Size**: The dataset contains thousands of images to ensure a rich learning experience for the model.
- **Image Dimensions**: Each image is resized to a uniform dimension (e.g., 28x28 or 64x64 pixels) to standardize input for the GAN.
- **Diversity**: Images represent various artistic styles, enhancing the generator's ability to produce unique art.

### Data Preprocessing:
Before training, the dataset is preprocessed, including:
- **Normalization**: Pixel values are scaled to the range [0, 1].
- **Augmentation**: Techniques such as rotation, flipping, and color adjustments are applied to increase variability and improve model robustness.

This dataset enables the GAN to learn diverse artistic features, resulting in the generation of unique synthetic images.
