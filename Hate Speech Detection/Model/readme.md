## Overview

The notebook builds a hate speech detection model based on text data, leveraging deep learning methods for binary classification. The notebook covers data loading, visualization, text preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, install the following dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn nltk scikit-learn tensorflow

## Contents of the Notebook 

Data Loading and Inspection: The notebook starts by loading the dataset and displaying basic information to understand its structure, size, and contents.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations, including class distributions and other graphical representations, are provided to offer insights into the data and identify any patterns that may impact model performance.

Text Preprocessing: Prepares the text data by removing unwanted characters, tokenizing, stemming, and removing stopwords, resulting in cleaner input for the model.

Model Training: A deep learning model is created, compiled, and trained on the processed data. The architecture may include layers like Embedding, LSTM, or Dense layers to handle text input effectively.

Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The evaluation results are displayed and visualized to provide a clear picture of model performance.

Visualization of Results: Accuracy and loss plots over training epochs are shown to analyze the model's training and validation performance.

## Results

The model achieves respectable performance metrics in detecting hate speech. Below are some key metrics:

Accuracy: Measures the overall correctness of the model.
Precision: Indicates the accuracy of positive predictions.
Recall: Measures how well the model captures positive samples.
F1 Score: Balances precision and recall for a more comprehensive view.
